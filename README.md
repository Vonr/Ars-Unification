# Ars Unification

Lets Ars Nouveau take recipes from other mods.

Currently, the mod will take Crush and Cut type recipes and let the respective glyphs use them.
I will **not** be adding multi-way recipe-stealing.

Ars Nouveau's base recipes will always take priority over ones from other mods.

Other mods' recipes can have their priorities configured in the common config file.
Specific recipes can also be disabled from being taken by putting their ID in the config.
You can obtain a recipe's ID using [EMI](https://modrinth.com/mod/emi).

Supported mods:
- [Actually Additions](https://modrinth.com/mod/actually-additions) (Crusher)
- [Ender IO](https://modrinth.com/mod/enderio) (SAG Mill)
- [Integrated Dynamics](https://modrinth.com/mod/integrated-dynamics) (Squeezer/Mechanical Squeezer)
