# Ars Unification

Lets Ars Nouveau take recipes from other mods.

Currently, the mod will take Crush and Cut type recipes and let the respective glyphs use them.

If [Not Enough Glyphs](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/not-enough-glyphs) is present,
processing capabilities will also be given to its Flatten glyph for Press type recipes.

I will **not** be adding multi-way recipe-stealing.

Recipes made specifically for Ars Nouveau will always take priority over ones from other mods.

Other mods' recipes can have their priorities configured in the common config file.
Specific recipes can also be disabled from being taken by putting matching Regular Expressions in the config.
You can obtain a recipe's ID using [EMI](https://modrinth.com/mod/emi).

Usage of [Almost Unified](https://modrinth.com/mod/almost-unified) is highly recommended, although it is not
required for the mod to function as it will reduce functionally duplicated recipes.
